    If I were asked to highlight a single quality in myself, it would be the
    love for what I do. Programming, in particular, is something I engage in for
    the sheer pleasure of creating.
  </p>
  <p class="text_content">
    As a frontend developer, I consider myself an artisan of CSS. I take joy in
    crafting beautiful and interactive components.
  </p>
  <p class="text_content">
    I studied in the "One Oracle Next Education" program, where I had the
    opportunity to be recognized as a "One Helper" for my supportive role in
    guiding my peers on their journey to becoming developers. We also initiated
    a live streaming program to provide valuable information, covering both hard
    and soft skills.
  </p>
  <p class="text_content">
  I was chosen to showcase my project live and, ultimately,
    deliver the graduation speech for the program. Currently, I remain actively
    involved as part of the student committee of One Oracle Next Education,
    where we continue organizing events for our alumni.
